Plug in your keyboard, record, export as .mid file to easily import into your DAW — or just use it as a convenient way to save your song ideas.

It should work with any MIDI controller (such as a drum pad, but it has not been tested for that).

It features a basic playback mechanism for the last recorded track. This is intended to playback through your connected MIDI device. This app is not a MIDI player.

This is app is incredibly simple (perhaps too simple for some). There are existing mobile DAWs that can record USB MIDI, with additional features baked in. This is meant for a certain workflow where you'd like to simply record using your phone or tablet — to save your song ideas, and/or import the .mid file into your desktop DAW afterwards.
